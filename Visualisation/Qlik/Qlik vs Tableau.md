### Overview

We have found in other Enterprises where QlikView has been implemented a dedicated team of QlikView developers is required. This is due to the specialist nature of the tool.  With a separate development team, reporting starts to drift out of the Business, which then often leads to miss-aligned objectives.  Qlik Sense also requires ongoing investment in skilled resources to perform data preparation. Both tools are not considered data discovery tools due to the need to know in advance what you want to achieve.

Tableau is seen as more of an intuitive tool due to it being very similar to Excel.  A sound understanding of an Excel workbook and a pivot table automatically makes the user proficient in Tableau.  This ease of use often means reporting can sit closer, if not in the Business itself.  Tableau's online tutorials and support are also excellent, enabling Business users to upskill quickly and cost effectively.

Tableau’s ease of use can lead to a governance issue.   Due to enabling anyone to generate any report using any data, more process and guidance is require to ascertain what can be called a valid report and what can not.  It is therefore recommended that a centre of excellence is created to advise on best practices and enforce governance.  Development stays in the Business; however, control over what can be released to the rest of the Business is centralised.  This model works better than having separate development teams as objectives can remain aligned.  The Business is responsible for the development and needs to adhere to a standard to publish to the rest of the enterprise.

### Qlik Sense

**Lack of flexibility**

- Hard to view underlying data
- Interactive capability is limited (drill down is automatic and can only be performed when hierarchy is at lowest level)
- Filtering focuses on live selections dynamically on the screen
- Can choose graph colour scheme but colours automatically assigned and cannot be changed

**Complexity **

- Not as intuitive as Tableau
- Challenging data preparation
- Tool uses proprietary language
- Calculations on-top of calculated fields requires additional data prep
- Calculation editor does not have a lot of inbuilt help functionality 
- Tools has limited use in data discovery



### Tableau

- OTTB functionality that Qlik Sense doesn’t currently offer (data handling, trend lines, histograms, colours, visual layout etc)
- It is easier to create different filters to filter data to reflect reporting requirements
- User help, training and support more straightforward and accessible
- Experience and skills more widely available in market
- Report development can sit deeper into the Business.
